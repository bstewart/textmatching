### Summary

This package implements the core functionality of the paper "Adjusting for Confounding with Text Matching."  We hope to add more features and methods going forward.  

The package currently includes functionality to:
* refit documents in an STM model under different content covariate level
* extract a projection onto a content covariate under an STM model
* use CEM to match on the extracted information
